            <h1>Raven Landing Database Upgrade</h1>
            <p>Raven landing is a senior community center in Fairbanks, Alaska. 
                During my senior year at UAF, me and a team of classmates met with
                the manager of Raven Landing to design a new database. The old
                database was done entirely with google sheets, and we were
                asked to create a more user friendly interface. Some of the things
                Raven Landing needed to keep records of include resident personal information,
                apartment information, waitlist information, and locks and keys.</p>
            <h1>Desktop Version</h1>
            <p>Here is what the interface looked like on a desktop computer:</p>
            <div class = desktopImages>
                <img id = "rlDesktop" src = "media/rlResidents.webp" alt = "A picture of desktop interface for raven landing database">
                <img id = "rlDesktop" src = "media/rlCars.webp" alt = "A picture of desktop interface for raven landing database">   
            </div>
            <h1>Mobile Version</h1>
            <p>It is also possible to access the database remotely with mobile devices, something
                the Raven Manager was pleased to have.</p>
            <div class = "mobileImages">
                <img id = "rlMobile" src = "media/rlMobileResidents.webp" alt = "A picture of mobile interface for raven landing database">
                <img id = "rlMobile" src = "media/rlMobilePerson.webp" alt = "A picture of mobile interface for raven landing database">
                <img id = "rlMobile" src = "media/rlMobileWaitlist.webp" alt = "A picture of mobile interface for raven landing database">
            </div>
