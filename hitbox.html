        <h1>Hit Box Controller</h1>
        <p>Hit Box is a company that makes specialized controllers for fighting games.
            What makes them unique is the leverless design, which allows for more 
            precision when performing complicated inputs. They run for about $250, 
            and I was able to create my own for around $60. I rested my hands on a piece of 
            paper and marked where my fingers were. Then I drilled holes into a plastic 
            sheet for a button layout that fit my hands. I used Sanwa buttons and a Brooks 
            arcade board for the components.
