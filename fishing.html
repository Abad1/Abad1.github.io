        <h1>Fishing Game</h1>
        <p>Me and a classmate created this game in our capstone class. It was heavily 
            inspired by the fishing minigame featured in Club Penguin. The idea to make 
            a Club Penguin game was suggested by a friend of mine. The game was built using 
            Godot, and the assets were all made in Microsoft Paint.
