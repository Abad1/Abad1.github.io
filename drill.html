        <h1>3D Printed Drill</h1>
        <p>For my final project in my robotics class, I built a drill using a 3D printed enclosure
            and some componets I soldered together. The enclosure was modeled using OpenSCAD and printed
            on delta printers with PLA. Two seperate printers were used to print both halves of the 
            enclosure at the same time, which resulted in asymetric lengths. The motor was much smaller
            than I anticipated, but ended up being decently strong. It's 12 volts, and sits snug in the 
            enclosure without screws. I also designed a bit holder to hold a hex drill bit, which is 
            attached to the motor with a small screw.
