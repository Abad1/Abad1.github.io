        <h1>Cuda Raytracing</h1>
        <p>This image was produced by a simple raytracing program that uses the distance from
            the pixel to the sphere to calculate the color. It was originally made to run on a single thread,
            and I converted it to use multiple threads with cuda to dramatically speedup the rendering time.
